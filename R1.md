## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2020

### Day 1: 07/09/2020 - Monday

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the RSAT. Trying to use PSCustomObjects to store information of registry keys (Path,Value,Name,Type, etc..).

**Thoughts:** `Try/Catch` blocks are good for error handling you get when (for example) trying to retrieve info about an non-existing registry key, but you must be careful with Terminating vs Non-Terminating errors. `Get-ItemProperty` does not return a terminating error, which means the **Catch** portion will be skipped.

This can be fixed by adding the parameter `-ErrorAction Stop` which changes it to a terminating error, making the catch block work.

### Day 2: 08/09/2020 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Continued work on RSAT. Used objects successfully to store values and properties of certain registry keys. Still need to finish clean up at the end of the script and it should be working.

**Thoughts:** The `Try/Catch` blocks that are in my script are awful, but they work! Way too much redundancy - they need to be changed into a single function as they're very prone to typos. Will fix that later after the dev branch is functioning exactly as expected!

I also had a harsh lesson in `=` vs `-eq`. Only the latter will compare, the former will actually set the value. Had me puzzled for a while when I had `$_.Changed = $true` in an if statement that always ran the if scriptblock, regardless of the actual value of `$_.Changed`

### Day 3: 09/09/2020 - Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Finished RSAT by completing the final block. Script now remembers what registry values were before script run. It's now fully functional under Powershell 7. 

**Thoughts:** Most of my time was spent testing the script, rather than coding - had some strange behavior because of faulty logic. Script will need to work under 5.1 for convenience - it shouldn't be too much work to refactor the code. Planning to do that tomorrow.

Still a few things left to be done:
- `Try/Catch` blocks still awful, need to be changed to single function.
- Should be working under Powershell 5.1 as well - currently it isn't
- Dev branch should be merged to the master branch

### Day 4: 10/09/2020 - Thursday

**Today's Progress:** Wrapped the `Try/Catch` blocks into a second function, merged into master. Then in the dev branch wrapped the second function into the first.

**Thoughts:** There's always a more efficient way to do things. After I wrote a function to remove the redundant `Try/Catch` blocks, I quickly realized that my two functions could actually be one function, and I spent the rest of my time merging the two. Was much easier than I thought.

The one thing left to do is to make it work with Powershell 5.1, which may take some work. Will see what I can do about it tomorrow!

### Day 5: 11/09/2020 - Friday

**Today's Progress:** Fixed code to work under Windows Powershell 5.1! First release.

**Thoughts:** Felt a bit like I spent most of my time today running around in circles trying to find why there were errors generated when running the code under Powershell 5.1 when the code was working fine under Powershell 7. 

The errors were all caused by a [bug in VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/102103). It was caused by the BOM in UTF-8 being doubled in the current version of VS Code. To fix, I needed to update VS Code, create a new file and copy/paste the code.

### Day 6: 12/09/2020 - Saturday

**Today's Progress:** New project, bit of research into writing functions properly from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/09-functions?view=powershell-7

**Thoughts:** Should really focus on getting my hour of coding done in the early morning, as later during the afternoon I have less motivation and more distractions.
