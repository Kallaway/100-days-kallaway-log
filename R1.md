## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2020

### Day 1: 07/09/2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the RSAT. Trying to use PSCustomObjects to store information of registry keys (Path,Value,Name,Type, etc..).

**Thoughts:** `Try/Catch` blocks are good for error handling you get when (for example) trying to retrieve info about an non-existing registry key, but you must be careful with Terminating vs Non-Terminating errors. `Get-ItemProperty` does not return a terminating error, which means the **Catch** portion will be skipped.

This can be fixed by adding the parameter `-ErrorAction Stop` which changes it to a terminating error, making the catch block work.

### Day 2: 08/09/2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued work on RSAT. Used objects successfully to store values and properties of certain registry keys. Still need to finish clean up at the end of the script and it should be working.

**Thoughts:** The `Try/Catch` blocks that are in my script are awful, but they work! Way too much redundancy - they need to be changed into a single function as they're very prone to typos. Will fix that later after the dev branch is functioning exactly as expected!

I also had a harsh lesson in `=` vs `-eq`. Only the latter will compare, the former will actually set the value. Had me puzzled for a while when I had `$_.Changed = $true` in an if statement that always ran the if scriptblock, regardless of the actual value of `$_.Changed`
