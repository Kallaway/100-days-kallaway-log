## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - done in 2020

### Day 1: 07/09/2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the RSAT. Trying to use PSCustomObjects to store information of registry keys (Path,Value,Name,Type, etc..).

**Thoughts:** `Try/Catch` blocks are good for error handling you get when (for example) trying to retrieve info about an non-existing registry key, but you must be careful with Terminating vs Non-Terminating errors. `Get-ItemProperty` does not return a terminating error, which means the **Catch** portion will be skipped.

This can be fixed by adding the parameter `-ErrorAction Stop` which changes it to a terminating error, making the catch block work.
